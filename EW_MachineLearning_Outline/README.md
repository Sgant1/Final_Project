# Machine Learning Models

### Overview:
A sample dataset of the preliminary wine data has been used to train and test three machine learning models. In this project the target variable is ‘Item/Bottle Count’ and can be predicted with a classification model for discrete numerical data. The goal is to have the model predict an integer amount of wine that will be sold.

### Data Preprocessing:
The data used in each model has been converted to numerical datatypes and encoded with LabelEncoder from Scikit Learn. 

***Note: It may be worth trying to encode the data with a different encoder to avoid overfitting.***
