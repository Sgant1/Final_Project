# Final_Project

## AmandaMorgan Updates
Working on cleaning the data- determine dtypes, editing dtypes to match the other files so they can be joined, dropping unecessary columns, joining the individual month csv's into one annual table for both 2020 and 2021, and then connect to SQL. Working on rough draft of that code this week. 

Copied from the Main Branch README:
Cleaned files, removing 19 columns, changing ship date and created date ffrom number format to Date format, then mass changed Company Name to Standard naming convention.


- Ecom1

All online sales based. 

Promotes primarily 3 pack & 6 pack boxes

Only ships 2 pack orders.

Club is monthly at the same time every month.

Primarily a gift based program. 

Didn’t ship 2/20, 3/20.

- Ecom3

Wine imports big struggle for this customer. Delays led to lack of product to sell.

Experienced more volume purchases than quality.

COVID surcharge from carriers cut into profitability reducing money spend on marketing.

- Winery1

Tasting room shut down until 2021.

Does a 4 pack club every quarter

- Winery2

No tasting room, but couldn’t perform private tastings due to COVID shutdown.

Bottle prices are more expensive than normal wineries, with consumers buying volume instead of quality it cut into their sales.
