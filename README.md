# Introduction

This project focuses on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted wine sales throughout the United States by analyzing wine shipment data from six companies between January 2019 through December 2021. The goal of the project is to analyze wine sales specifically before, during, and after COVID 19 stay-at-home orders. We will analyze wine sales by state and zip code, as well as analyze sales based on state political alignment, and whether or not stay-at-home orders were in place.

We were motivated to begin this project as three of our team members work in the wine industry and we all consider ourselves wine enthusiasts. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted all industries including wine producers and sellers. We have all noticed changes in how much wine people seem to be consuming throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and we intend to try and prove (or disprove) this trend with data.

# Data

Team member Steve Gant is employed by a 3rd party logistics company and has been given permission to access datasets from the six randomly selected wine companies. The datasets contain information on wine sales by order number, company, ship date, state, zip code, shipping service, date created, weight of shipment, and item/bottle count. This data does not contain any private customer information or sales dollar amounts.
- For the purpose of this analysis we will be defining consumption/sales volume as the number of bottles shipped to the consumer.
- We will also be focusing on the date the order was created as the purchase date rather than the shipment date--the date the wine actually shipped out to the customer. We consider this to be a more accurate indicator of a customer's motivation to create a wine purchase.

- We will be using the 2019 shipping data to establish a baseline for sales pre-pandemic. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic began around January of 2020 with many states issuing lockdowns and Shelter in Place orders around March/April 2020 and extended through around May/June of 2020. Wine shipment data for the year 2021 will be used to describe the post-pandemic/recovery period in this data story.

- The data set includes wines shipped to all states except where prohibited by law. As is the case for the states of Rhode Island, Mississippi, and Utah.
