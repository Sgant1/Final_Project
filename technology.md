# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage

We will be storing our data in PostgreSQL ad using PgAdmin 4 to display the data.

## Machine Learning

We used Scikit Learn, Pandas and Matplotlib for the Machine Learning portion of the project. We loaded the data from Pandas. We used Scikit Learn's LabelEncoder() to encode features. We used Scikit Learn's Random Forest Regressor model to make predictions and the metrics mean_squared_error and mean_absolute_error to measure accuracy. Lastly we used Matplotlib to display the results.

## Dashboard

In addition to using a __ template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___. Looking at using Tableau to fomrulate dashboards.
