Instead, licensed direct shippers are allowed to use standard age verification procedures to ship off-site sales to Indiana consumers. The new law also removes the surety bond requirement and increases the total amount of wine a direct shipper may sell into the state from 3,000 to 5,000 cases per permit year. SB 113 also changes permit fee to a tiered structure based on the amount of wine sold to consumers during the previous calendar year– all wineries shipping 1,000 cases or less into the state pay a $100 fee. Those shipping more than 1000 cases will face a tiered structure that tops out at $500 for those shipping up to 5,000 cases in the permit year.","
